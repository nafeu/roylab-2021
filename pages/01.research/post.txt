In it, he described his preliminary investigation into C. elegans’ sensitivity to small molecules. Only 2 of the ~100 bioactive molecules he tested exhibited activity. Consequently, few people have championed the worm as a model system for the discovery of novel bioactive molecules that could be developed as biological reagents or potential drug leads.  My group’s work over the past 15 years, however, has challenged this general view by demonstrating that the worm has untapped potential to serve as a powerful platform with which to identify and characterize new small molecule tools and potential drug leads. Below, we describe some of our ‘greatest hits’.","large":false}},{"type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"Nemadipine","level":2}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"In our first screen for molecules that are bioactive in C. elegans way back in 2003, we screened 10,000 small molecules for the induction of a variety of phenotypes, including those that resemble the disruption of conserved components and pathways.","large":false}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"The first molecule we characterized in detail was a molecule we call nemadipine. Trevor Kwok, our PhD student who headed this project, found nemadipine to be a new L-type calcium channel antagonist that is active in both worms and vertebrates. Nemadipine has unique properties compared to other FDA-approved calcium channel antagonists in that it is effective in whole living worms. While nemadipine has little utility as an anthelmintic, the wactive allowed us to investigate the genetics of how animals interact with this important class of calcium channel antagonists for this first time. We published this work in Nature (Kwok et al., 2006), and have two follow-up papers on the screening method (Burns et al., 2006. Nature Protocols) and the use of nemadipine to study calcium channels (Kwok et al., 2008. PLoS Genetics).","large":false}},{"type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"Dafadine","level":2}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"The second wactive molecule that we characterized in detail we called dafadine. Genna Luciani, our PhD student who discovered dafadine and lead this project, found that dafadine induces a highly penetrant dauer phenotype in C. elegans. Dauer is a stress-resistant alternative third larval stage that is engaged in response to stress.  The genetic analysis of dauer engagement has led to many fundamental insights, including the discovery that the insulin pathway, which is one of two key pathways that controls dauer formation, negatively regulates lifespan. Together with our collaborators, Genna demonstrated that the DAF-9 cytochrome P450, which functions within the insulin pathway, is the direct and physiological target of dafadine.","large":false}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"We also found that dafadine can also antagonize DAF-9’s human ortholog, called CYP27A1. Because of the insulin pathway’s role in regulating lifespan, we tested whether dafadine could extend the life span of&nbsp;C. elegans, and found that it did so by inhibiting DAF-9 activity (Luciani et al., 2011.&nbsp;Nature Chemical Biology, PMID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22057127\">22057127</a>). Since publication, both nemadipine and dafadine have been commercially available and are being used by several others in the community as research tools.","large":false}},{"type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"wactive-11","level":2}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"After completing the characterization of dafadine, Genna Luciani, and Andrew Burns, a post-doctoral fellow in the lab, screened and characterized over 70,000 molecules to identify those that might have bioactivity that is restricted to nematodes. Here, we began to focus our efforts to develop molecules as nematicides and potential anthelmintics.","large":false}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Genna and Andrew found over 600 potent bioactive molecules that we call ‘worm active’, or ‘wactive’ molecules. 275 of these kill C. elegans larvae. Genna screened these 600 wactive molecules against Cooperia oncophora and Haemonchus contortus , which are parasitic nematodes of sheep and cows, respectively, in collaboration with John Gilleard (Calgary). We also counter-screened our bioactive molecules in vertebrate models, including zebrafish and a human cell line.","large":false}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"We found 67 compounds representing 30 distinct chemotypes that kill nematodes but not the vertebrate models. Andrew focused on one family of molecules, called the wact-11 family, which has good specificity for nematodes. Andrew demonstrated that wact-11 inhibits complex II of the electron transport chain. He found that it has nematode-specificity likely because of five residues on vertebrate channels that disrupts the interaction between the protein complex and the wact-11 family (see Burns et al., 2015, PMID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108372\">26108372</a>).","large":false}},{"type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"understanding","level":2}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"how small molecules interact with nematodes","level":5}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Andrew Burns, as a PhD student in our lab, performed the first survey of the accumulation and metabolism of 1,000 drug-like small molecules in the worm to better understand how small molecules evade the worm's defenses. We developed a structure-based accumulation model that identifies sub-structural elements that facilitate small-molecule accumulation in the worm. Preselecting molecules that are more likely to reach a target by first applying our model to the millions of available compounds will undoubtedly increase the success of future small-molecule screens with&nbsp;C. elegans. We published this work in Nature Chem Bio (Burns et al., 2010, PMID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512140\">20512140</a>).","large":false}},{"type":"delimiter","data":{}},{"type":"header","data":{"text":"wactive-86","level":2}},{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"A team in the lab, including Andrew Burns, a post-doc, Genna Luciani, a PhD student, and Rachel Bagg, a technician, worked together to identify new small molecules that interact with aldicarb, which is a highly effective treatment for plant-parasitic nematodes whose toxicity hampers its utility. From our collection of 638 worm-active (wactive) compounds, they identified 20 molecules that interact positively with aldicarb to either kill or arrest the growth of&nbsp;Caenorhabditis&nbsp;elegans. Andrew then investigated the mechanism of interaction between aldicarb and one of these novel nematicides called wact-86. Andrew found that the carboxylesterase enzyme GES-1 hydrolyzes wact-86, and that the interaction is manifested by aldicarb's inhibition of wact-86's metabolism by GES-1. This work demonstrates the utility of&nbsp;C.&nbsp;elegans&nbsp;as a platform to search for new molecules that can positively interact with industrial nematicides, and provides proof-of-concept for prospective discovery efforts (see Burns et al., 2017, PMID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28379972\">28379972</a>).","large":false}}],"version":"2.18.0"}
